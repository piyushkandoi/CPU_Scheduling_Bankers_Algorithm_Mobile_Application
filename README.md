# ANDROID APP FOR CALCULATIONS IN CPU SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS AND BANKER'S ALGORITHM
This app was made to calculate the waiting time, turn around time, deadlock detection, etc. for different CPU Scheduling Algorithms like FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Priority, Round Robin, etc.
It takes user input as processes with their burst times, arrival times, and priorities and gives the respective results. 
It also allows to check for deadlock using bankers algorithm.
